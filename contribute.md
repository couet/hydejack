We warmly welcome external contributions to the ROOT! By providing code, you agree
to transfer your copyright on the code to the "ROOT project". Of course you will
be duly credited and your name will appear on the [contributors](https://root.cern.ch/node/87) page and in the
[CREDITS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/root-mirror/root/master/README/CREDITS) file shipped with every binary and source distribution. The copyright
transfer is necessary for us to be able to effectively defend the project in case
of litigation.

Presently, there are two ways in which you can contribute:

##### 1. <b>Via the Users' contribution section in the Forum</b>
The Users' Forum has a [section](https://root-forum.cern.ch/c/my-root-app-and-ideas) which describes how to submit contributions.
It is the easiest way to make your code known to the community, even if it will
not be automatically integrated in ROOT. Of course the most successful contributions
will become part of the repository!

##### <b>2. Sending Patches</b>
You can send us a patch or a pull request with [Github](https://github.com/root-project/root),
provided that you follow these two simple rules:

  - Make sure you follow the [ROOT coding conventions]({{ "coding_conventions" | relative_url }}) in your code
  - Make sure you provide a set of tests for your feature/bug fix

Often it is useful to [contact us](https://root.cern.ch/node/2105) first to discuss the code you want to develop or
the bug you want to fix.

### Picking up an <i>Idea</i>

We maintain a set of "ideas" for talented scientists and developers to pick up.
An "idea" is a sketch of a development project, a functionality a missing feature
we would like to see in our tool, in your ROOT! You can inspect the ideas in the
following list.

#### Ideas
##### 30-01-2019 [Transform GNU-makefile tests to CMake](https://root.cern.ch/transform-gnu-makefile-tests-cmake)
ROOT's test suite has several crucial tests that still try on GNU-Makefile. We need to integrate them with CMake.

##### 30-01-2019 [Better argument parsing](https://root.cern.ch/better-argument-parsing)
Use a C++ command line argument library for defining and parsing ROOT's options.

##### 30-01-2019 [More tests, more benchmarks!](https://root.cern.ch/more-tests-more-benchmarks)
ROOT relies on testing, including performance testing - and we need to improve both.

##### 05-01-2016 [Wanted: A tool to 'warn' user of inefficient (for I/O) construct in data model](https://root.cern.ch/wanted-tool-warn-user-inefficient-io-construct-data-model)
A tool to 'warn' user of inefficient (for I/O) construct in data model

##### 02-09-2015 [Wanted: Storage of HEP data via key/value storage solutions](https://root.cern.ch/wanted-storage-hep-data-keyvalue-storage-solutions)
Interface the ROOT I/O to key/value stores.

#### Completed ideas
##### 28-03-2015 [Commandline tools for ROOT files inspection, modification and automated plotting](https://root.cern.ch/commandline-tools-root-files-inspection-modification-and-automated-plotting)
Create a unix-like set of Python command line tools to explore, modify and display the content of ROOT files.
