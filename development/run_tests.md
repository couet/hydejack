## Running the ROOT battery of tests

Running all ROOT tests on at least a platform before sending a PR or before pushing
anything to the ROOT repository is mandatory. The ROOT continuous integration
infrastructure allows to automatically check the PR also on a battery of platform,
for example including macos and linux boxes. In order to be able to run all tests,
the simple steps below need to be followed

### Prepare your development area and build ROOT

```
mkdir RootDevelopment
cd RootDevelopment
git clone https://github.com/root-project/root
git clone https://github.com/root-project/roottest
mkdir build
cd build
echo Note the cmake options
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -Dtesting=ON -Droottest=ON ../root
```

### Inspect and run the tests

From within the build directory:

 - List all tests: `ctest -N`
 - List all test matching a regex: `ctest -N -R myregex`
 - Run all tests on N cores: `ctest -j N`
