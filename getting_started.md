On behalf of the developers, contributors and user community: welcome to ROOT!

The ROOT beginners' guide (aka "Primer") is certainly the first document to read
to master the power of ROOT.

After this introduction, [these slides (and video!)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/395198/)
offer a different, more direct approach to the ROOT fundamental concepts as well
as some hands-on exercise. In order to integrate the information present in the
aforementioned sources, these resources are definitively useful. Once the fundamental
concepts have been acquired, a rich set of code examples can be found here.

Remember, you can always resort to the [ROOT Forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch)
to find out if someone already solved the problem you are facing or to get help!
