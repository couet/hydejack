- 02-02-2019 [Full Totem Analysis based on RDataFrame and distributed on a big Spark cluster with PyRDF!](https://root.cern.ch/full-totem-analysis-based-rdataframe-and-distributed-big-spark-cluster-pyrdf)
  Milosz Blaszkiewicz and Aleksandra Mnich (AGH University of Science and Technology - Poland)
  wanted to evaluate a set of Big Data tools for the analysis of the data from the TOTEM
  experiment which will enable interactive or semi-interactive work with large amounts of data.
  They ended up re-implementing a full Totem analysis in a declarative fashion using
  [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) and distributing
  their calculations over a big Spark cluster with [PyRDF](https://github.com/shravan97/PyRDF).
  Check it out on [CDS](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2655457)!

- 30-01-2019 [More tests, more benchmarks!](https://root.cern.ch/more-tests-more-benchmarks)
  ROOT relies on testing, including performance testing - and we need to improve both.

- 30-01-2019 [Better argument parsing](https://root.cern.ch/better-argument-parsing)

  We need to integrate them with CMake.

- 11-07-2018 [RDataFrame session at CHEP 2018](https://root.cern.ch/rdataframe-session-chep-2018-0)
  Join the CHEP 2018 BOF to discuss bout the Future of ROOT Based Analysis: sign
  up [here](https://doodle.com/poll/28e2wrrq2tga3wcn) and visit the
  [indico agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/743070/).

  Too much data? Too many cores? TTree analysis is tedious? Come and enjoy an intro
  plus discussion of RDataFrame, ROOT's current-generation way of writing super-efficient
  analyses! It moves all the intricacies into ROOT's responsibility, leaving you
  simply with a declarative formulation of the filters and computations that make
  up your analysis.

- 17-01-2018 [ROOT Users' Workshop 2018](https://root.cern.ch/root-users-workshop-2018)
  The ROOT team would like to invite you to the [11th ROOT Users' Workshop](https://cern.ch/root2018).

  This time we meet in [Sarajevo](http://visitsarajevo.ba/?lang=en), the capital
  of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a buzzing
  melting pot of cultures since centuries. The workshop features four days of
  presentations and discussions on everything ROOT: what works for you, what
  doesn't and how ROOT evolves to address future challenges. ROOT is changing;
  this is your chance to influence what happens and to interact with all its
  developers! Our way of saying "thank you for participating" is to make sure that
  you have a great time in a unique location!
